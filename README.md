# Gesture-controlled-keyboard
Why did it took so long to make?
I am a noob at this field so that it took a long to make firstly I had the most embrassing problem that the code wasn't working for notepad and browsers that was the main thing that this project was targeted for getting keyboard input virtually and it wasn't working so i had to use the AI for solving this problem at first i tried it on my own using the tutos and everything so it took more than expected time for me to make this.
what does this do?
this is a virtual keyboard that gives input through the hand gestures.I don't know why i made this but its pretty cool..........
